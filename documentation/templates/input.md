At the same time, Iâve been exploring some new AI tools for work, and Iâm both amazed and slightly overwhelmed at how fast things are changing in tech. Balancing curiosity with intentional living is becoming its own kind of discipline.

Also started journaling again â not every day, but whenever something weighs on my mind. I find that writing, even just a few lines, helps me reset.

Anyone else feeling that urge to slow down while everything else speeds up?",

      "body": "Driving the Future: How Technology is Transforming Transportation\nTransportation has always been the engine of progressâmoving people, goods, and ideas across cities, countries, and continents. But in the 21st century, itâs not just about getting from point A to point B. Itâs about how we get there: faster, safer, cleaner, and smarter. And at the heart of this transformation? Technology.\n\n1. Autonomous Vehicles: From Sci-Fi to Street Legal\nWhat was once a futuristic dream is now cruising through city streets. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) use AI, sensors, and real-time data to navigate without human input. Companies like Waymo, Tesla, and Cruise are already testing and deploying self-driving cars, while autonomous trucks promise to revolutionize logistics and supply chains. The potential benefits are huge: fewer accidents, reduced congestion, and more accessible transportation for the elderly and disabled.\n\n2. Electrification: Powering a Sustainable Tomorrow\nThe shift from fossil fuels to electric power is reshaping the automotive industry. Electric vehicles (EVs) are no longer nicheâthey're mainstream. Governments are offering incentives, automakers are committing to electric-only futures, and battery tech is advancing rapidly. Beyond cars, electric buses, bikes, and even airplanes are emerging, helping reduce emissions and create a cleaner planet.\n\n3. Smart Infrastructure: Cities That Talk Back\nRoads, traffic lights, and parking lots are getting an upgrade. Smart infrastructure uses IoT (Internet of Things) sensors and connectivity to manage traffic flow, detect maintenance needs, and even communicate with autonomous vehicles. Imagine a traffic signal that adapts in real time to reduce congestion or a parking lot that directs you to an open spot. These innovations aren't just coolâthey improve safety, reduce fuel use, and enhance urban life.\n\n4. Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS): The End of Car Ownership?\nWith apps like Uber, Lyft, Bird, and Lime, personal car ownership is becoming less necessary in urban environments. MaaS platforms integrate various transport optionsâbikes, scooters, rideshares, public transitâinto a single, seamless service. Add in AI-powered route planning, and getting around becomes effortless, personalized, and more eco-friendly.\n\n5. Hyperloop & High-Speed Rail: Redefining Long-Distance Travel\nWhile still in early stages, hyperloop technologyâpropelling pods through low-pressure tubes at airplane speedsâcould dramatically shorten travel times between major cities. Meanwhile, countries like Japan and France continue to lead the way with efficient high-speed rail, showing the world whatâs possible with investment in advanced public transport.\n\n6. Data-Driven Decisions: Analytics Behind the Wheel\nEvery vehicle on the road today is a rolling data center. From GPS tracking to engine diagnostics, real-time data helps optimize routes, predict maintenance issues, and improve safety. Municipalities and logistics companies alike are leveraging this data to make smarter transportation decisions, reduce emissions, and cut costs.\n\nThe Road Ahead\nTechnology isnât just changing how we moveâitâs changing whatâs possible. The intersection of AI, data, automation, and sustainability is creating a transportation revolution. But as we accelerate toward the future, we must ensure equity, safety, and accessibility for all. The journey has just begun.",

# Forget Password

This endpoint is a state API that manages password change by users. It manages the three stages of password change which it infers based on payload. Three stages are 1. OTP generation and sending 2. OTP/Hash verification 3. Password Change. Sending only email as payload discards any existing OTP and generates a new one which it sends to the email data. Sending only Hash or OTP verifies the hash and marks the user eligible for a password change. N.B: This eligibility is time constrained. 3. Sending email,password1 and password2 checks the eligibilty of the user and if eligible, changes the password accoridingly. Also note that there is only a single eligibility per password request and any immediate change must again be routed through the entire flow.
